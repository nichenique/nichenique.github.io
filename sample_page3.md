##  The Disparity In Opportunity For Addtional Help In Studies Between High And Low Income Family Students

**Project description:** 
This is a side project that I am currently exploring. When I was experimenting with the free data found on data.gov.sg,
I extracted the data of amount spent on education by family from different income per capita and crossed it with their total income. The result is both interesting and revealing. The percentage spent by different income per capita family on education is actually similar, 5-7%.
This shows that the families place equal emphasis on the importance of education but the quality of education received differs due to income level.

### [Stay tuned!!]
